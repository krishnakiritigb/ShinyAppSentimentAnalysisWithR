# ShinyAppSentimentAnalysisWithR
This project is an interactive R Shiny web application that performs sentiment analysis on airline reviews. Motivated by inconsistencies between customer ratings and written reviews, the app classifies user-submitted or dataset-based reviews of British Airways into positive or negative sentiment.
