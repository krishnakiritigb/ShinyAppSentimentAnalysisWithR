# ShinyAppSentimentAnalysisWithR
This project is an interactive R Shiny web application that performs sentiment analysis on airline reviews. Motivated by inconsistencies between customer ratings and written reviews, the app classifies user-submitted or dataset-based reviews of British Airways into positive or negative sentiment.


# Sentiment Analysis on British Airways Reviews  

An interactive **R Shiny** web application that performs **sentiment analysis** on British Airways customer reviews. The model uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to categorize reviews as **positive** or **negative**, helping travelers make informed decisions.

## Background  

Sentiment Analysis is a sub-domain of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that applies machine learning and computational linguistic tools to identify the **feeling or emotion** behind text. It is also known as **opinion mining**.  

The primary goal is to analyze whether a review expresses:  
- üòä Positive sentiment  
- üò† Negative sentiment  
- üòê Neutral sentiment  

The dataset (sourced from **Kaggle**) contains British Airways reviews, including **titles, reviews, ratings, trip verification, and more**. This project focuses on classifying reviews into positive or negative sentiment.

##  Model ‚Äì Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

We used **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** as the classifier.  

- **Supervised learning algorithm** trained on labeled data (positive/negative reviews).  
- Finds a **hyperplane** that best separates the two classes.  
- Supports both **linear and nonlinear classification** using kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid).  
- Optimized with **hyperparameter tuning** and tested for accuracy.  

**Steps Involved**  
1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Feature Selection  
3. Training Data Selection  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Hyperparameter Tuning  
7. Prediction

## Purpose  

The main objective is to build a system that can:  

- Classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**, regardless of numeric rating inconsistencies.  
- Help travelers decide if the **flying experience is worth the cost**.  
- Provide airlines (like British Airways, Uber, DoorDash, etc.) with tools to **filter fake/misaligned reviews** and improve their services.  

Example anomaly:  
A user wrote, *‚ÄúWorst flight ever‚Äù* but still gave a rating of **8/10**. Such inconsistencies can affect decision-making. Our classifier corrects this by focusing on **review text + rating authenticity**.
